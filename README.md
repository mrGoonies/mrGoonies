## üßë‚Äçüíª mrGoonies's coding journey
My journey into computer science began in 2023, when I decided to take the first step and begin studying programming. I started by learning Python, which allowed me to understand the fundamentals of programming logic and develop a solid foundation in problem-solving.

Over time, I delved into the world of relational databases, understanding how to structure, query, and manage information efficiently, which reinforced my interest in building functional and well-organized applications.

Currently, I'm focused on web development, exploring both the front- and back-end aspects. I'm excited about creating solutions that not only work correctly but also provide a good user experience. This approach has led me to constantly learn and share some of that knowledge through articles on Medium.

**My goal is to continue growing as a developer, combining my studies, practical experience, and constant curiosity to make my way in the tech world.**
